Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to extract valuable insights. Specifically, we aim to:

Calculate the total number of orders and overall revenue.
Identify the highest-priced pizza and the most frequently ordered size.
List the top 5 pizza types based on order frequency.
Analyze the distribution of orders by hour and determine the average daily orders.
Evaluate the revenue contribution of each pizza type and identify cumulative revenue trends.

Key Insights:

Size Trends: Large pizzas are the most popular, informing our inventory management.
Top Sellers: Classic and Chicken pizzas lead in popularity. Focusing promotions on these could boost sales.
Peak Ordering Times: Orders spike around noon and early afternoon. Adjusting staffing during these hours can improve service.
Average Daily Sales: We sell about 138 pizzas daily, which helps optimize inventory and staffing decisions.
Best Performers: Chicken-based pizzas, especially Thai Chicken and Barbecue Chicken, are top sellers, alongside classics like Classic Deluxe and Hawaiian.
